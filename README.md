# tiddlywiki-plugins-km-keynav
Keyboard Navigation plugin for TiddlyWiki to support navigating the Story River using keyboard instead of mouse. 

This repo contains a client-server tiddlywiki with the referenced keynav plugin in the plugins folder. You can download the plugins/keynav folder and add it to your wiki to load the plugin. Alternatively, open the standalone index.html file, which contains the same TiddlyWiki and drag the tag pill $:/km/keynav from there to your own TiddlyWiki to import it.
