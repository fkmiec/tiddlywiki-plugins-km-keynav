# tiddlywiki-plugins-km-keynav
Keyboard Navigation plugin for TiddlyWiki to support navigating the Story River using keyboard instead of mouse. 

This repo contains a client-server tiddlywiki with the referenced keynav plugin in the plugins folder. You can download the plugins/keynav folder and add it to your wiki to load the plugin. Alternatively, save a copy of the raw index.html file to your local drive and open it in your browser. You will see the standalone version of this TiddlyWiki. From there, you can drag the tag pill $:/km/keynav to your own TiddlyWiki to import it.
